# Assets Guide

The assets used in our unity simulation are freely available, however, their licence prohibit us to share the assets without linking to the original creators.
Instead, we will give below a list of all assets we have used, and how you can obtain the assets by yourself.

## Bird

The collection not only provides the left shown bird we used in our simulations, but also other breeds.
